## Common Questions

### "Do I need all the physical components to start?"

**No!** You can start with:
- 6 quartz crystals ($12-30)
- Computer speakers
- Written intention on paper

The software will work with this minimal setup. Enhanced components amplify power, but the basic system functions immediately.

### "Is this scientifically proven?"

Radionics operates in the realm of:
- Subtle energy (orgone, chi, prana)
- Consciousness and intention
- Quantum information theory
- Traditional esoteric practices

Scientific validation is limited, but user reports span decades. Approach with open-minded skepticism and personal experimentation.

### "Can this replace medical treatment?"

**NO.** This is complementary practice:
- ✅ Use alongside conventional medicine
- ✅ Use for spiritual development
- ✅ Use for meditation support
- ❌ Do NOT replace professional medical care
- ❌ Do NOT stop medications without doctor approval

### "What if I don't believe in crystals/energy/etc.?"

The system can work as:
- Meditation support and intention-focusing tool
- Sound therapy and harmonic frequency generation
- Structured prayer and contemplation practice
- Creative ritual and symbolic action

Belief is not required - sincere intention and experimentation are.

### "How much does it cost?"

**Software:** Free and open source

**Hardware:**
- Level 1 (basic): $20-50
- Level 2 (enhanced): $100-200
- Level 3 (advanced): $300-600
- Level 4 (professional): $800-1500

Most users find Level 2 optimal (powerful yet affordable).

### "How long does it take to see results?"

Varies greatly:
- Some report immediate subjective effects (peace, clarity)
- Physical manifestations: days to weeks to months
- Continuous practice yields cumulative benefits
- Results depend on: intention clarity, device quality, consciousness practice, cosmic timing

**Recommended:** 30-day consistent practice before evaluating effectiveness.

3. Intention crystallization (feel it complete)
4. Mudra (Shakti for manifestation, Gyan for wisdom)

**During Broadcasting:**
1. Visualization (light flowing to recipients)
2. Detachment from outcomes
3. Continuous compassion

**After Broadcasting:**
1. Merit dedication ("May all beings benefit")
2. Gratitude to crystals and technology
3. Grounding (touch earth)
