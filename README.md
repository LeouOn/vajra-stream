# Vajra.Stream - Digital Dharma Technology

**Sacred technology for continuous blessing, healing, and purification**

> "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" - Heart Sutra

This system combines traditional dharma practices with modern technology to create continuous streams of blessing and healing intention, amplified through crystal grids, scalar wave generation, and digital emanation.

## Philosophy

From the Cittamatra perspective, all phenomena arise from mind - the silicon circuits, crystalline structures, electromagnetic fields, and our intentions are all empty of inherent existence yet perfectly functional in conventional reality. This project uses these dreamlike means in service of benefit for all beings.

## Features

- **Continuous Blessing Engine**: 24/7 generation of merit and positive intention
- **Crystal Grid Broadcasting**: Physical amplification through sacred geometry
- **Personal Healing Module**: Chakra/meridian focused energy work
- **Kalachakra Time-Space Purification**: Astrological timing and location-based practices
- **Dharma Tales Generator**: AI-powered teaching stories and parables
- **Scalar Wave Generation**: Audio frequency synthesis (0.6-1000 Hz)
- **Multi-modal Output**: Visual, audio, physical device integration

## Hardware Levels

### Level 2: Passive Crystal Grid
- Computer audio output
- 6-12 quartz crystals in sacred geometry
- Optional orgonite pieces
- **Cost**: $40-60
- **Setup Time**: 30 minutes

### Level 3: Active Amplification
- Small stereo amplifier (Lepai LP-2020A)
- Bass shaker transducer (Dayton BST-1)
- Crystal grid on vibrating platform
- **Cost**: $110 total
- **Setup Time**: 2 hours

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vajra-stream.git
cd vajra-stream

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up database
python scripts/setup_database.py
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a simple blessing (Level 2)
python scripts/run_blessing.py --intention "May all beings be happy" --duration 300

# With healing focus
python scripts/run_blessing.py --mode healing --chakra heart --duration 600

# Continuous background blessing
python scripts/run_blessing.py --continuous
```

### Hardware Setup

#### Level 2: Crystal Grid
1. Arrange 6 quartz crystals in hexagon pattern (6-8 inch radius)
2. Points facing inward toward center
3. Place intention (written/photo) in center
4. Position in front of computer speakers
5. Run blessing software

#### Level 3: Amplified Setup
1. Mount bass shaker to underside of wooden platform
2. Wire shaker to amplifier RIGHT channel
3. Connect computer → amplifier (3.5mm to RCA)
4. Rebuild crystal grid on top of platform
5. Set amplifier volume to 25-40%
6. Run blessing software

## Configuration

Edit `config/settings.py`:

```python
# Audio settings
SAMPLE_RATE = 44100
AUDIO_DEVICE = 'default'

# Hardware
HARDWARE_LEVEL = 2  # 2 = passive, 3 = amplified
AMPLIFIER_CONNECTED = False

# Default frequencies
BLESSING_FREQUENCIES = [7.83, 136.1, 528, 639, 741]

# Database
DB_PATH = 'vajra_stream.db'
```

## Knowledge Base

Pre-loaded reference data:
- 50+ mantras with Sanskrit/Tibetan/English
- 7 chakras + Vajrayana subtle body channels
- 100+ frequencies (Solfeggio, planetary, Schumann)
- Archetypal patterns for story generation
- Astrological correspondences
- Sacred day calendars

## Safety & Disclaimers

- This device is for spiritual practice only
- Not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease
- Keep amplifier volume at safe levels
- Supervise any electronic devices
- Crystals are minerals and should be handled with care

## Philosophy & View

This technology is **upaya** (skillful means) - a tool to support practice, not replace it. The computer cannot generate compassion or wisdom; only you can do that. This system amplifies and structures your intention, providing continuous support for your practice.

From the emptiness teachings: none of this has inherent existence. The blessing doesn't "exist" in the crystals or the frequencies or the software. Yet through dependent origination, causes and conditions come together, and benefit arises. We work with conventional reality while maintaining ultimate view.
