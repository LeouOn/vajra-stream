## 4. Safe Operational Guidelines

### 4.1 Thermal Management

**The Cybershaman Lesson**: Respect the hardware!

```python
# Monitor CPU temperature
max_temp = 85°C  # Conservative limit
target_temp = 75°C  # Target operating temp

if cpu_temp > max_temp:
    reduce_intensity(50%)
elif cpu_temp > target_temp:
    reduce_intensity(25%)
```

**Cooling Strategies:**
- Monitor temps continuously
- Adaptive throttling
- Duty cycling (work/rest periods)
- Spread across cores
- Reduce clock speed if needed

### 4.2 Power Management

**Sustainable Operation:**
- 60-80% max CPU utilization
- Allow cores to sleep periodically
- Use CPU affinity wisely
- Monitor system load

**Battery Consideration:**
- Reduce intensity on battery power
- Full power only when plugged in
- Respect battery health

### 4.3 Duty Cycling

**Sacred Rhythms:**
```
Work Period: 108 seconds (sacred number)
Rest Period: 27 seconds (1/4 work)
Total Cycle: 135 seconds
Duty Cycle: 80%
```

**Alternation:**
- Switch between methods
