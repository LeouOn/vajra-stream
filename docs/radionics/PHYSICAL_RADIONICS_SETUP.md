## Quick Start - Simple Crystal Grid

**You can start TODAY with minimal materials.**

### Level 1: Basic Setup (5 minutes, $20-50)

**Materials:**
- 6 clear quartz crystal points (1-2 inches each)
- Paper and pen for written intentions
- Computer speakers or bass shaker
- Wooden base or natural surface

**Assembly:**
1. Arrange 6 quartz crystals in a hexagon (6-8 inch radius)
2. Point all crystals inward toward center
3. Write your intention clearly on paper
4. Place intention paper in the center
5. Position grid in front of speakers or on bass shaker
6. Run software: `python scripts/radionics_operation.py --preset world_peace`

**This works!** The software generates harmonic frequencies that vibrate the crystals, which amplify and broadcast your intention.

## Understanding the Components

### How Radionics Works

From the Cittamatra (Mind-Only) Buddhist perspective and quantum information theory:

1. **Consciousness is primary** - Your focused intention is the source energy
2. **Physical objects as structural links** - Crystals, geometry, and materials create information channels
3. **Frequency as carrier wave** - Sound/electromagnetic waves organize and broadcast the pattern
4. **Non-local information transfer** - The broadcast operates at the informational level, beyond space-time constraints

### Orgonite Construction

Orgonite is a matrix that accumulates and transforms orgone energy (life force, prana, chi).

#### What is Orgonite?

**Composition:**
- 50% organic material (resin: polyester, epoxy, or resin casting compound)
- 50% inorganic material (metal shavings: aluminum, copper, brass, steel)
- Quartz crystal (whole or chips) to organize the energy field

**How it Works:**
1. **Accumulation:** Organic resin attracts and holds orgone
2. **Reflection:** Metal particles reflect orgone rapidly
3. **Transformation:** Continuous contraction/expansion creates "scrubbing" effect
4. **Organization:** Quartz crystal structures the field into coherent patterns

Orgonite continuously transforms DOR (dead/deadly orgone) into OR (organized, beneficial orgone).

#### DIY Orgonite Recipe

**Materials for 3-inch pyramid or disc:**
- 1 cup clear casting resin
- 1 cup metal shavings (aluminum, copper mix ideal)
- 1 small quartz point or handful of chips
- Mold (silicone pyramid, muffin tin, PVC pipe section)
- Copper wire (optional: spiral/coil design)

**Construction:**
1. Create copper spiral or Rodin coil (optional)
2. Place quartz crystal in mold pointing upward
3. Add copper coil around/beneath crystal
4. Mix metal shavings into container
5. Mix resin according to manufacturer directions
6. Pour resin over metal shavings in layers
7. Ensure crystal remains pointed upward
8. Allow to cure fully (24-72 hours)
9. Remove from mold, polish if desired

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Layering:** Alternate resin and metal for "cake" effect
- **Rodin coils:** Wind copper in 1-2-4-8-7-5 pattern
- **Sacred geometry:** Embed copper wire in Flower of Life, Sri Yantra patterns
- **Crystal matrix:** Multiple small quartz points throughout
- **Gold/silver flakes:** Add precious metals for enhanced conductivity

**Cost:** $10-30 per piece DIY, $20-100 purchased

#### Orgone Generator vs. Simple Orgonite

**Simple Orgonite** (passive):
- Accumulates ambient orgone
- Transforms DOR to OR
- No active generation

**Orgone Generator** (active):
- Includes electromagnetic driver (coil + frequency)
- Actively pulls in and multiplies orgone
- Can be powered by Vajra.Stream software frequencies
- 10x+ amplification compared to passive orgonite

**Building an Orgone Generator:**
1. Construct large orgonite base (6-12 inch diameter)
2. Embed copper coil (20-50 winds) connected to amplifier
3. Power coil with audio frequency (7.83 Hz Schumann resonance ideal)
4. Vajra.Stream can output specific frequencies through audio output
5. Result: Active orgone multiplication field

## Crystal and Mineral Attunement

Crystals and minerals must be **cleansed, charged, and attuned** to work optimally with your intention.

### Initial Cleansing (Do Once When New)

**Purpose:** Remove previous energetic imprints and restore neutral state

**Methods (choose one or combine):**

1. **Water cleansing** (safe for quartz, avoid soft stones)
   - Rinse under cool running water for 2-3 minutes
   - Visualize all previous energy washing away
   - Dry gently with natural cloth

2. **Salt burial**
   - Bury crystals in sea salt or rock salt
   - Leave for 3-24 hours
   - Brush off salt, do not rinse (salt absorbs negative energy)

3. **Smoke cleansing**
   - Pass crystals through sage, palo santo, or incense smoke
   - Cover all surfaces for 30-60 seconds each
   - Set intention: "I cleanse this crystal of all previous imprints"

4. **Sound cleansing**
   - Use Vajra.Stream software!
   - Run: `python scripts/radionics_operation.py --intention "crystal cleansing" --duration 600 --no-astrology`
   - Place crystals on grid during broadcast
   - 10 minutes is sufficient

**Shungite note:** Shungite is self-cleansing and does not absorb negative energy (it transmutes it), so cleansing optional.

### Charging (Do Monthly or When Energy Feels Depleted)

**Purpose:** Fill crystals with beneficial energy

**Methods:**

1. **Sunlight charging**
   - Place crystals in direct sunlight for 2-4 hours
   - Morning sun preferred (gentle)
   - Avoid prolonged sun for amethyst, rose quartz (color may fade)
   - Best for: Clear quartz, citrine, carnelian

2. **Moonlight charging** (MOST POWERFUL)
   - Place crystals under full moon overnight
   - Can leave outside or on windowsill
   - Moonlight safe for all crystals
   - Bonus: Place on silver plate for amplification
   - Best for: All crystals, especially feminine energy stones

3. **Earth charging**
   - Bury crystals in earth for 24 hours
   - Mark location so you can find them!
   - Earth restores grounding and natural resonance
   - Best for: Grounding stones, infinity stones, black tourmaline

4. **Crystal cluster charging**
   - Place smaller crystals on large quartz cluster or selenite plate
   - Leave for 6-24 hours
   - Selenite is self-charging and charges other crystals
   - Best for: Regular maintenance charging

### Personal Attunement (Do Before First Use and Periodically)

**Purpose:** Imprint crystals with YOUR unique energy signature and intention

**Protocol (15-30 minutes):**

1. **Preparation**
   - Sit comfortably in quiet space
   - Arrange crystals before you
   - Light candle or incense (optional)
   - Take 3 deep breaths, settle mind

   - See thousand-petaled lotus opening (Sahasrara chakra)
   - Feel connection to universal energy, Source, Buddha-nature
   - Breathing meditation: "Breathing in, I receive divine light. Breathing out, I radiate compassion."

3. **Individual crystal attunement**
   - Hold each crystal in both hands (at heart level)
   - Close eyes, feel its natural vibration
   - State aloud: "I attune this [crystal name] to serve the highest good of all beings"
   - Visualize your heart light flowing into the crystal
   - See crystal glowing with intention
   - Continue for 1-2 minutes per crystal
   - Place aside when complete

4. **Grid attunement**
   - Extend hands over entire assembled grid (palms down, 6 inches above)
   - Visualize all crystals connecting with lines of light
   - Form sacred geometry pattern (hexagram, Flower of Life, etc.)
   - State: "May this crystal grid amplify healing, peace, and awakening for all beings everywhere"
   - Hold visualization for 3-5 minutes
   - Feel energy building, pulsing, activating

5. **Sealing**
   - Clap hands once sharply above grid (disperses stagnant energy)
   - Touch earth or ground (release excess)
   - Bow to grid (respect and gratitude)
   - Complete with: "It is done. May all beings benefit. Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!"

**Frequency:**
- Before first use
- Monthly during full moon
- After any intense broadcasting session (crystal energy can deplete)
- Whenever grid "feels" less responsive

```

### Optimal Timing

**Best Times by Intention Type:**

| Intention | Best Moon Phase | Best Time of Day | Duration |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Healing/Repair | New Moon | Sunrise or Brahma Muhurta (96 min before sunrise) | 1-2 hours |
| Peace/Calm | Full Moon | Evening twilight | 2-3 hours |
| Protection | Waning Moon | Sunset | 1 hour |
| Awakening/Clarity | Waxing Moon | Dawn | 30-90 min |
| Manifestation | New → Full Moon | Midday (sun peak) | 2-4 hours |
| Release/Banishing | Full → New Moon | Midnight | 1-2 hours |

**Astrological Alignment:**

Use the built-in astrology features:
```bash
python scripts/vajra_orchestrator.py astrology --latitude YOUR_LAT --longitude YOUR_LON
```

Pay attention to:
- **Moon phase and mansion (Nakshatra)**
- **Planetary hours** (each hour ruled by a planet)
- **Auspicious times** (system provides recommendations)
- **Void of Course Moon** (avoid major operations during these periods)

### Crystal Grid Maintenance

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Cleanse grid with sage smoke or sound (5 min)
- [ ] Check crystal positions (ensure none have shifted)
- [ ] Update written intentions if needed
- [ ] Run test broadcast to verify function

**Monthly (Full Moon):**
- [ ] Complete cleansing of all crystals (method of choice)
- [ ] Moonlight charging (leave grid under full moon overnight)
- [ ] Re-attunement meditation (20-30 min)
- [ ] Check bass shaker/audio connections
- [ ] Clean wooden base and any dust accumulation

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Disassemble grid completely
- [ ] Deep cleansing (salt burial or water)
- [ ] Inspect crystals for damage or cloudiness
- [ ] Replace any depleted orgonite
- [ ] Rebuild with fresh attunement
- [ ] Update sacred geometry base if desired

**Signs Grid Needs Attention:**
- Crystals appear cloudy or dull
- Pendulum shows weak or irregular response
- GV measurements consistently low
- You feel less connection during meditation
- Results seem diminished

### Safety and Ethics

**Medical Disclaimer:**

⚠️ **This device is NOT a medical treatment.**
- Do not use as replacement for professional medical care
- Do not stop medications without doctor approval
- Radionics is complementary, not alternative to medicine
- Inform health practitioners of all modalities you use

**Ethical Guidelines:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Broadcast for highest good of all
- ✅ Include free will clause: "if it serves their path"
- ✅ Focus on positive outcomes (health, peace, awakening)
- ✅ Obtain consent for individual-specific healing when possible
- ✅ Dedicate merit to all beings
- ✅ Maintain pure motivation (compassion, service)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Try to control others' decisions or will
- ❌ Broadcast harm, negativity, or selfish gain
- ❌ Manipulate outcomes against someone's highest good
- ❌ Expect guaranteed physical-world results
- ❌ Use as substitute for your own meditation practice
- ❌ Broadcast without ethical consideration

**Energetic Hygiene:**

Broadcasting generates and moves significant subtle energy. Protect yourself:

- **Cleanse your own energy field weekly:** Salt baths, sage, or energy healing
- **Ground after sessions:** Walk barefoot, touch earth, physical exercise
- **Maintain spiritual practice:** Meditation, prayer, ethical conduct
- **Monitor your state:** If feeling drained, reduce broadcast frequency
- **Set boundaries:** You are not responsible for outcomes, only pure intention

## Troubleshooting

### "Crystals don't seem to be vibrating"

**Check:**
- Bass shaker connected to correct audio output?
- Volume level 30-50% (too low won't transmit)?
- Bass shaker placed correctly under grid base?
- Try test: `python scripts/test_prayer_bowl_audio.py`

**Solution:**
- Increase volume gradually until subtle vibration felt
- Place hand on bass shaker to verify it's working
- Some vibration is subtle - not all crystals will visibly shake

### "GV measurements always low"

**Check:**
- Are you taking multiple measurements (`--count 20+`)?
- Is moon in waning phase or void of course (naturally lower energy)?
- Are crystals cleansed and charged recently?
- Have you performed personal attunement?

**Solution:**
- Cleanse and charge crystals (moonlight)
- Perform full attunement meditation
- Check timing - avoid unfavorable astrological periods
- Increase sample size - GV uses randomness, larger samples more accurate

### "Device feels 'dead' or unresponsive"

**Check:**
- When was last cleansing/charging?
- When was last personal attunement?
- Are there heavy EMF sources nearby (WiFi router, cell tower)?

**Solution:**
- Complete grid disassembly and cleansing
- Full moon charging overnight
- 30-minute attunement meditation with mudras
- Add shungite EMF protection around device
- Relocate away from EMF sources if possible

### "Getting opposite results (things getting worse)"

**Check:**
- Is intention phrased positively? (Use "health" not "remove disease")
- Are you attached to specific outcomes?
- Is there ethical alignment with highest good?
- Might this be temporary "healing crisis" (worse before better)?

**Solution:**
- Rephrase intentions in positive terms
- Add clause: "for highest good of all concerned"
- Release attachment to outcomes
- Trust the process - sometimes healing involves surfacing issues
- Reduce intensity/duration and build gradually
- Consult spiritual teacher or counselor

### "Audio plays but visualization doesn't generate"

**Check:**
- Is Pillow library installed? `pip install Pillow`
- Is `generated/rothko/` directory present?
- Check error messages in console

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p generated/rothko
pip install Pillow
python scripts/radionics_operation.py --intention "test" --duration 60
```

### "Software can't connect to LLM"

**Check:**
- Environment variables set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`?
- OR local model in `./models/` directory?

**Solution:**
- Use `--no-prayer` flag to skip LLM-generated prayers
- System will use traditional prayers from library
- Or set up API key or local model per QUICKSTART.md
