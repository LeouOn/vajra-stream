## Project Philosophy

> **Cittamatra View**: All of this—silicon, crystals, frequencies, intention—is mind, empty yet functional. We're using dreamlike means for benefit in this dreamlike reality.

The computer doesn't generate compassion. The crystals don't create blessing. **You do.** This technology amplifies and structures what you bring to it.

## Support & Development

This is your project now! Modify, extend, share.

**Future additions** (we can build together):
- Healing module (chakras/meridians)
- Time-space purification (Kalachakra)
- Story generator (dharma tales)
- Visual display system
- LLM orchestration
- Mobile outputs

## Dedication

_May whatever benefit arises from this technology flow to all beings._

_May all beings be happy. May all beings be free from suffering._

_May all beings awaken to their true nature._ 🙏
